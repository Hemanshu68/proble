        Let's begin with the adventurous years that we experience!
        Our college life is just as exciting, where we encounter ups and downs like being on a roller coaster ride. There were exciting moments along with stressful, anxious, apprehensive, scary, and triumphant moments. The college years are genuinely extraordinary and a wonderful point in life where we take mature steps towards our future, meeting many friends, choosing our majors, finalizing our professions, and preparing for the challenges of the real world. We will go through a lot of crashes during the semesters, but we also enjoyed the journey in between. It is really an amazing journey. Moreover, it is the best experience one could have had.  
        As the roller coaster went higher, we would usually deal with many challenges, obstructions and struggles to get to our destination and goals, much like Ville from Easterine Kire’ When the River Sleeps. However, with time, we have learnt to find the silver lining. 
        Most of the randomness, with a good amount of insight about opportunities would be open to us whenever we confront any event or workshop. 
        
        
        Studies with Fun!
        We have enjoyed our college life fully.In first year, we didn’t know much so we all had great fun. In the second year, when we attended webinars workshops of IITs NITs, we bucked up and started working with the basics. Did CS subjects thoroughly, Focussing on Operating Systems, DDMS etc. Everyone should start DATA STRUCTURE ALGORITHMS from the first year only. We learned the biggest thing in our College life: how to tackle different people and handle the situations.
